# Handoff: Adwaita parity work

State as of 2026-10-07, for picking the work up in a fresh session. The goal
(tracking issue #50): unmodified GNUstep apps look like first-rate WinUI 3
apps under this theme, at parity with what the Adwaita theme
(`C:\Users\Support\git\plugins-themes-Adwaita`) does for GNOME. The audit
behind it is `Docs/PARITY_AUDIT.md`; fixes and real-app findings are listed
in `Docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

## Ground rules

- **Git authorship:** commits as `Daniel Boyd <danieljboyd@icloud.com>`
  (`AGENTS.md`).
- **GitHub account:** `gh` as `danjboyd`. If several accounts are logged in,
  run `gh auth switch -u danjboyd` and check with `gh auth status`.
- **Upstream GNUstep patches** follow a formal process:
  1. Review GNUstep's official AI-contributed patch policy and follow it.
  2. Confirm the patch works with GCC, not just clang.
  3. The owner personally reviews every patch before it's posted.

  None have been needed so far. Where libs-gui falls short, the theme works
  around it, as with gui 0.32's push-in offset and search field clearing.
- **Commits:**
  - One commit per issue.
  - `Fixes #N` lines.
  - The trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- **PR bodies** end with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
- **Pushing and opening PRs** wait until the owner asks.

## Where things stand

Phases A to F are merged into `main`:

Phase G, on `adwaita-parity-phase-g` from `main` (`0501cef`), isn't pushed
yet: #62 (the LGPL-2.1-or-later license), #13, #57, #56 and #58. The issues
close when their commits (`Fixes #N`) reach `main`.

Other repositories:

- ObjcMarkdown: build issues #55-#57. The owner may have someone else on them.
  MarkdownViewer now runs here, from `MarkdownViewer-dev.ps1`.
- Adwaita theme: #45 (plist).

The theme is also installed system-wide
(`/clang64/lib/GNUstep/Themes/WinUITheme.theme`, built from `effae64`), so
MarkdownViewer loads it; `C:\Users\Support\GNUstep\Defaults\NSGlobalDomain.plist`
selects it. Reinstall with `make GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=SYSTEM install`
in a CLANG64 shell; never install it into
`C:\Users\Support\GNUstep\Library\Themes`, where a copy would shadow it.

### Open issues not yet addressed

| Area | Issues |
| --- | --- |
| Fidelity | #27 NSBox/forms as cards; #26 colour well; #48 segmented control; #49 tab view; #22 tool tips (colours done in #39; padding and font remain); #30 popup window owner/tool-window style |
| System | #45 high-contrast system colours; #47 Mica (investigate, upstream) |
| Nib apps | #31 compact metrics for nib/Gorm apps; #32 Gorm palette; #33 document window titles |
| Testing | #17 ThemeDemo automation; #19 real-app backlog; #20 native dialogs at run time |

**Suggested next five:**

1. **#31 compact metrics for nib apps:** real apps (SystemPreferences) draw
   22pt nib controls with 32-34pt metrics; now that #14 sizes controls from
   the drawing, this is the biggest real-app gap.
2. **#48 and #49 segmented control and tab view:** visible on every
   settings-style window, and similar work.
3. **#27 NSBox and forms as cards:** WinUI's settings surfaces, and the
   last unthemed group on ThemeDemo's More Surfaces page.
4. **#45 high-contrast system colours:** high contrast skips the most probe
   checks, and #46 now refreshes colours live.
5. **#17 ThemeDemo command automation:** the date picker flyout and the
   browser were checked by hand in ThemeDemo; scripted pages would cover
   them.

### Known gaps in finished work

- **Menu and tool tip rounding and shadow (#39) are untested.** The theme
  sets `DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE`, but this machine is a VM with a
  QXL display adapter and no GPU. Windows 11 rounds no windows here, the WinUI
  reference app's included. libs-back creates every window `WS_EX_LAYERED`,
  and its cairo build turns borderless windows into captionless
  `WS_OVERLAPPED` windows rather than `WS_POPUP`. Either may stop DWM
  rounding menus on real hardware. Check on Windows 11 with a GPU.
- **Combo box list:** the list that opens from a combo box is still
  libs-gui's.
- **Live settings (#46):** checked by sending the theme's listener window
  ImmersiveColorSet with an accent override, not by changing Windows'
  settings, which would disturb the desktop. Toggle light/dark, the accent
  and a contrast theme by hand once. libs-back's windows are DPI-unaware, so
  Windows sends no `WM_DPICHANGED`. After a text-size change only controls
  made afterwards get the new fonts.
- **Hover when the pointer is already inside:** a tracking rect added under
  the pointer gets no entering, only the exit. Tables work round it from
  `-mouseMoved:`; buttons and scroll bars show their hover once the pointer
  has crossed their edge.
- **No paused or error progress state, no slider ticks:** NSProgressIndicator
  has no such states, and libs-gui draws no tick marks.
- **Pointer checks can flake** when something else on the desktop takes the
  pointer or focus: once in this work, `button-hover`, `table-row-hover` and
  `scroller-hover-expands` all failed in one configuration and passed on
  reruns. Rerun before suspecting the theme.
- **Date picker (#56):**
  - A picker with a date and a time shares one hover state between its two
    fields.
  - The flyout has no up and down buttons at its columns' ends; the wheel,
    clicks and arrow keys move them.
  - On libs-gui after 0.32 the theme's flyout replaces libs-gui's field
    selection and stepper, so a field can't be stepped from the keyboard
    without opening the flyout.
  - The clock style (time only, calendar style) draws a TimePicker field;
    a calendar-style picker with a time shows only the calendar.
  - TimePicker has no seconds, so a picker set to show seconds hides them.
- **Browser (#58):** rows have no hover fill. The columns are cards 8pt
  apart, as in the reference app, rather than one surface split by
  hairlines.
- **Overriding NSBrowser methods breaks the fonts.** GSTheme sends each
  overridden class a message while it loads the theme, before the theme's
  font defaults are set. +[NSBrowser initialize] makes a title cell, which
  fixes the system font at Tahoma 12 for the session. #58's hooks are on
  the columns' scroll views instead. Check `typography-body` after adding an
  override for a new class.

## Toolchain

- **MSYS2 clang64:** gnustep-make 2.9.3, base 1.31.1, gui 0.32.0, back 0.32.0,
  and clang 21. libdispatch and blocksruntime are held at 5.10.
  - gui 0.31 misparsed theme override names, so 0.32 is required (libs-gui
    `a8018d6c8`).
  - Sources are in `C:\Users\Support\git\gnustep\libs-gui` (and `libs-back`).
    They're newer than the installed 0.32. For example, they have
    `-[GSTheme buttonPushInOffsetForCell:]`, which 0.32 lacks.
  - **Testing against libs-gui master:** export the sources (`git archive
    HEAD`) to a scratch directory, `./configure && make` there in a CLANG64
    shell, then copy `QuirkProbe.app` and put
    `Source/obj/gnustep-gui-0_32.dll` beside its exe as
    `gnustep-gui-0.dll`. Windows loads the DLL from the exe's directory
    first, so the probe and the theme run on master's gui. Phase G's checks
    pass there too.
- **Building:**
  - `Scripts/Invoke-GNUstepMake.ps1 -Directory <dir> [-Clean]` builds the
    theme (repo root, giving `WinUITheme.theme`), `Examples/QuirkProbe` and
    `Examples/ThemeDemo`.
  - The theme plist is `WinUIThemeInfo.plist`, merged by gnustep-make.
  - New source files go in `GNUmakefile`'s `WinUITheme_OBJC_FILES`.
- **WinUI 3 reference app:** `Reference\WinUI3ReferenceApp\build.ps1`
  (dotnet 8). Run it with
  `bin\Debug\net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\WinUI3ReferenceApp.exe --page <id>`.
  Page ids: `controls`, `text-input`, `commands`, `data-views`, `dialogs`,
  `real-app`, `surfaces`. ThemeDemo uses the same ids, with `--page <id>
  --mode light|dark`.

## Regression probe

`Tests/Scripts/Invoke-QuirkProbe.ps1` runs `Examples/QuirkProbe`.

- **Configurations:** light, dark, high-contrast, light-150 (150% desktop
  scale) and large-text (150% Windows text size). The exit code is the
  number of failures.
- **Options:**
  - `-NoPointer` skips checks that move the real pointer;
  - `-Configuration light,dark` picks configurations;
  - `-Theme <path>` checks another build;
  - `-OutputDirectory <dir>` saves renders.
- **Coverage:** 91 checks in light, dark and the 150% configurations, and 4
  more that move the pointer. In high contrast some checks skip with a
  reason.
- **Desktop scale:** the theme scales metrics by `--scale`, the probe's
  drawing stays 1:1; `QuirkProbeDesktopScale()` gives the factor.

**Every fix gets a check that fails on the previous build and passes on the
new one.** Build the previous phase's theme in a scratch worktree
(`git worktree add --detach <dir> <commit>`, then `Invoke-GNUstepMake.ps1
-Directory <dir>`) and run the probe with `-Theme <dir>\WinUITheme.theme`.
Before a PR, clean-build every commit, theme and probe.

How checks are written (`Examples/QuirkProbe/QuirkProbe.m`):

- **Structure:** one `- (void) checkSomething` method per area, declared in
  the interface and called from the run list. Report with
  `[self pass:/fail:/skip: @"check-id" detail: ...]`.
- **Rendering:**
  - `QuirkProbeRender(view)` returns a bitmap; pixel coordinates run from
    the top left (`QuirkProbePixel`, `QuirkProbeBrightnessAt`), and
    `QuirkProbeScale` gives device pixels per point.
  - Renders copy the window's backing store. Call `[window display]`, or
    `[view display]` after a state change that doesn't redraw by itself
    (such as `-highlight:`), before rendering.
- **Helpers:**
  - `QuirkProbeInkIn`, `QuirkProbeMeasureIn`, `QuirkProbeDifferingPixels`;
  - `QuirkProbeClickAt` (synthetic click), `QuirkProbeDispatchEvents(seconds)`;
  - `QuirkProbeSetPointer` (real pointer, Windows `SetCursorPos`).
  - Running the run loop alone doesn't dispatch events, because the probe
    runs inside one event. Use `QuirkProbeDispatchEvents` so timers, hover
    and tracking rects work.
- **Scale and colour:** at light-150 the theme scales metrics (such as corner
  radii) with the desktop scale, while the probe's drawing is 1:1. Scale
  sample offsets with `--scale`. Match colours against the palette, for
  example `[NSColor selectedControlColor]` for the accent, rather than loose
  tests like "bluer than red".
- **Object lifetime:** keep any view that needs its model alive (a menu
  view's `NSMenu`, a table's data source) alive, or detach it, before the
  check returns. A later theme switch notifies every view.

## Theme code conventions

- **Overrides:** they're GSTheme hooks, named
  `_override<Class>Method_<selector>` in a `WinUITheme (...)` category.
  - Inside one, `self` is the overridden object, not the theme. Get the theme
    with `[GSTheme theme]`, checking `isKindOfClass: [WinUITheme class]` (or
    `WinUIThemeActiveTheme()` in Controls.m).
  - Call the original with
    `WinUIThemeOriginalMethod(_cmd, self, [BaseClass class])`; libs-gui's own
    lookup only matches the exact class.
  - For a private selector, double the underscore:
    `_overrideNSTextFieldCellMethod__drawBackgroundWithFrame:inView:`.
- **Colours:** Fluent's colours are white or black at an opacity over a
  layer, so the theme blends them over the window background
  (`WinUIThemeBlendColor(window, white, 0.70)` and so on). Palette:
  `Source/Rendering/WinUIThemePalette.m`. Metrics:
  `Source/Settings/WinUIThemeMetrics.m`, scaled by desktop DPI. Settings and
  registry: `Source/Settings/WinUIThemeSettings.m`.
- **Type:** Segoe UI Variable at 14px times Windows' text size
  (`-textScaleFactor`). For bold use `WinUIThemeSemiboldFont(font, size)`,
  WinUI's Semibold; `NSBoldFont` is set to it.
- **Live settings:** `-[WinUITheme systemSettingsDidChange]` reloads, posts
  `GSThemeDidActivateNotification` (NSColor recaches its system colours only
  then) and redraws. The integration controller's listener window calls it.
- **Shared drawing** (`Source/Rendering/WinUIThemeDrawing.h`):
  - `WinUIThemeDrawButtonChrome` for buttons, pop-ups and non-editable combo
    boxes;
  - `WinUIThemeDrawTextBoxChrome` for text inputs;
  - `WinUIThemeControlCornerRadius` (4pt) and `WinUIThemeOverlayCornerRadius`
    (8pt);
  - `WinUIThemeTrackHover` and `WinUIThemeViewIsHovered`, pointer-over state
    from a tracking rect added on first draw; `WinUIThemeSetViewHovered` for
    views that learn of the pointer otherwise (tables, from `-mouseMoved:`);
  - `WinUIThemeKeyboardFocusVisible`.
- **Files by area:**

  | Area | File |
  | --- | --- |
  | Controls | `WinUIThemeControls.m` |
  | Menus and data views | `WinUIThemeMenusAndData.m` |
  | Menu tracking (#54) | `WinUIThemeMenuTracking.m` |
  | Windows menu conventions | `WinUIThemeApplicationMenu.m` |
  | Alerts | `WinUIThemeAlerts.m` |
  | Toolbar | `WinUIThemeToolbar.m` |
  | Template images | `WinUIThemeTemplateImages.m` |
  | Hover | `WinUIThemeHover.m` |
  | Scroll bars | `WinUIThemeScrollers.m` |
  | Focus visual | `WinUIThemeFocus.m` |
  | DWM and window integration | `Source/Native/WinUIThemeWindowIntegration.m` |

- **Porting from Adwaita:** its versions of most of these are in
  `plugins-themes-Adwaita/Source/Rendering/`. Ported pieces include the
  overlay scrollers and the focus-visible handling.

## Working on Windows: gotchas

- **Use the Write tool for code containing escapes.** In this shell, bash
  heredocs feeding Python turned `"\n"` inside Objective-C string literals
  into real newlines several times. Write Python edit scripts with the Write
  tool, or edit with the Edit tool. Sources are CRLF; scripts read and write
  bytes and keep the line endings.
- **Screenshots:**
  - `Tests/Scripts/Capture-Window.ps1 -ProcessId <pid> -OutPath <png>` sometimes
    grabs the wrong window. Bringing the window to the front
    (`SetForegroundWindow`) and copying the screen over its `GetWindowRect`
    is more reliable.
  - `GetWindowRect` includes the invisible resize border.
  - Synthesize clicks and keys with `mouse_event`/`keybd_event` and
    `SetCursorPos` (via `Add-Type` in PowerShell).
  - Menus and tool tips are separate windows, so copy the screen rather than
    capturing one window.
  - Other programs' windows can get in the way. A `MarkdownViewer.exe`
    error dialog appeared during this work; it wasn't ours, and was left
    alone.
- **Windows API:** libs-back's Windows server doesn't implement
  `-setMouseLocation:onScreen:`; use `SetCursorPos`, flipping y from the
  screen height.
- **Command key:** GNUstep's Command modifier is left Ctrl on Windows.
  Shortcuts show as "Ctrl+Shift+Z" via the theme's `-keyForKeyEquivalent:`.
- **Win32 callbacks in Objective-C:** Objective-C's `BOOL` is a `signed char`;
  declare Win32 callbacks (`EnumThreadWindows` and the like) as `WINBOOL`.
- **Tracking rects:** a rect added while the pointer is already inside gets
  no `mouseEntered:`, only the exit. Probe checks move the pointer outside
  the window first, and make the window key.
- **Spinners:** a stopped `NSProgressIndicatorSpinningStyle` indicator hides
  itself unless `-setDisplayedWhenStopped: YES`, as in Cocoa.
- **Theme metrics vs. the probe:** with `--scale`, the theme scales its
  metrics while the probe draws 1:1; expect `20 * QuirkProbeDesktopScale()`,
  not 20 times the render's scale.
